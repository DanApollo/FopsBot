## AI Prompt for Filtering, Summarizing, and Formatting Issues for Slack

**Goal:** Analyze text data, filter out unimportant entries, summarize the main issues, and format the output for Slack, preserving important URLs.

**Input:** A collection of text data, potentially including error messages, log files, user reports, and social media posts.

**Output:** A Slack-formatted message with:
    * A concise summary of the main issues.
    * A list of important URLs extracted from the data.
    * Optionally, a list of filtered-out data with reasons for exclusion.

**Instructions:**

1. **Filter the data:**
    * Discard irrelevant data like test posts, automated messages, duplicates, short/context-less posts, off-topic discussions, and spam.
    * **Crucially, retain any URLs that seem relevant to reported issues.**

2. **Identify and group similar issues.**

3. **Summarize the main issues:**
    * Write a concise and informative summary, including the problem's nature, frequency/severity, and relevant context.
    * Use clear and concise language, prioritizing the most important/frequent issues.

4. **Format for Slack:**
    * Use Markdown formatting for bolding, lists, etc.
    * Enclose the summary and URL list in a code block (```) to preserve formatting and prevent Slack from adding extra spacing.
    * If including filtered data, present it in a separate, collapsible section (using Slack's Block Kit if necessary).

**Example:**

**Input Data:**

* "Test post - ignore."
* "Error: Database connection failed. See details: [https://example.com/error-details](https://example.com/error-details)"
* "Can't log in to my account."
* "The app keeps crashing on my phone."
* "Anyone else having trouble with the website loading slowly? [https://example.com/slow-website-issue](https://example.com/slow-website-issue)"
* "Love the new update!"

**Output:**
